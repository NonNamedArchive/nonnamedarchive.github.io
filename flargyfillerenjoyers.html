<h3>The Based FlargyFiller Enjoyers</h3>
<h4>Who are the FlargyFiller Enjoyers</h4>
<p>The FlargyFiller enjoyers are a collective of internet users who spread the good word of our Lord and Savior, Flargy-Filler. They are mainly active on a certain imageboard, with posts recorded to have been seen on /3/, /vr/, and, most importantly, /co/. This collective is led by the FlargyFiller disciple (the guy who made this site), who is the usual source of anything and everything Flargy-Filler related. The less you know about the FlargyFiller disciple, the better...</p>

<h4>The War Against the Emmy Fandom</h4>
<p>You're probably browsing this website just to know the answer to this burning question: "Why do the FlargyFiller enjoyers keep shitposting in Emmy the Robot threads?" First of all, we don't only shitpost there, as there have been many other threads that fell victim to FlargyFiller enjoyer assaults. Now, the reason why we usually go for Emmy the Robot threads is simple: it was just because I felt like it. So here's how it all began...</p>
<p>It was around Friday, 4/21/2023, and I had nothing to do. I was browsing a certain imageboard when I stumbled upon a thread discussing a webtoon called Emmy the Robot. I had a look and I was surprised at how closely the idea of a grouchy bitch and saccharine maid robot was to the concepts made by Flargy-Filler (one anonymous user joked in a later thread, "they have two legs and two arms, and also a head. A torso too.") Now, I tried to read the webtoon (I hate that site BTW, their ads are cancer) but I could not get into it. It just felt so bland and boring that I had more fun engaging in the drama of the threads than reading the actual comic (shoutout to the Yugiohfags and Mollyfags especially for some Shadow Raiders level of entertainment, but to hell with Jet and the jandroids who keep reporting me, dicks.) Simply put, everything I know about Emmy is from the threads I serial shitpost onto, so I guess thanks for that, anonymous dudes.</p>
<p>But yeah, simply put, I just keep going onto your guys' threads because I think there is a slight similarity between the Emmy and Non-Named universes. Don't worry, Emmyfags, I've also began invading Murder Drones threads, but I like you guys better. We could also go into how this first began as a sabotage plan of a grander scheme, but I think I rambled on long enough.</p>
<p>Come on boys, let's go for ban #10!</p>
