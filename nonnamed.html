<h3>Non-Named: A Game to Surpass Mother and Completely Ass-Rape Oddity</h3>
<h4>What the Hell is Non-Named?</h4>
<p>Long ago in a distant past (12/21/2015, feel old yet?), Flargy-Filler made his first post discussing the game Non-Named (known as Untitled at the time). This video game was a Role-Playing Game (RPG) modeled after the style of the Game Boy Advance games Mother 3 and Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga and created using the Stencyl engine. Development would be documented on two different sources: the Stencyl Forums and the VGResource Forums; on 11/9/2018, all further progress would be documented on a now lost Twitter account: "Flargy1".</p>
<p>The devlopment of Non-Named is one of great tragedy, as Flargy-Filler progresses on fulfilling his dreams before ultimately failing as he had in grade 12 and in life. We see how Flargy-Filler's disdain with his characters grew in near real-time, with Callie and Mills throwing Mills's little brother, Lenny, down a memory-hole before many frequent breaks caused the game to fall into disarray. Truly, a tragedy.</p>
<br>
<h4>Important Characters of Non-Named</h4>
<h5>Mills</h5>
<p>Mills, formerly known as Milly according to a 8/29/2017 concept art posted on Stencyl, is the main protagonist of Non-Named. The older sister of Lenny and best friend of Callie, Mills is a saccharine and absentminded young lady. Brunette, curvy, and very beautiful, this Pollyanna finds herself embroiled in a quest to rediscover who she was after being abducted by a malevolent alien force a decade ago; this quest for discovery eventually unravels into a grand conspiracy that holds all of humanity at risk.</p>
<h5>Callie</h5>
<p>Callie is the deuteragonist of Non-Named. A foil for Mills, Callie begins the story as a timid young girl and, after her best friend was abducted, grows into a bitter and spiteful woman. Tall, flat, and muscular, Callie is a force to be reckoned with. Everyone who makes the mistake of appearing submissive to Callie will be ruthlessly bullied by her; Lenny is a personal favorite victim, with the pleasure she gets from bullying him bordering on sexual pleasure. Despite her horrid nature and brash exterior, Callie is a surprisingly vulnerable girl, with those able to break through her tough exterior seeing how truly broken of an individual she is. A journey to help her only friend Mills rediscover who she was only causes more trouble between the two friends.</p>
<h5>Lenny and the Family</h5>
<p>Lenny is a supporting character in Non-Named. The baby brother of Mills, though at this point a teenage boy, Lenny serves as the annoying yet kind-hearted worker for Mills's family while she was gone. Lenny has a love-hate relationship with Callie: while he loves how Callie looks, he hates how she keeps serving his ass on a silver platter everytime they meet.</p>
<h5>The Amberosa</h5>
<p>The Amberosa is an eldritch being from an era long ago. After destroying its own universe, the Amberosa thought it was a good time to take a nap and landed on planet Earth to rest. While resting in the Atlantic Ocean, the Amberosa was awoken by these silly creatures called humans constructing an artificial island over its tomb. Angered, the Amberosa unleashed its horrible drones and began its quest to conquer the known universe for retribution. However, as the Amberosa assembled its forces, it felt that having an emmissary for its Great Unification was a better option...now, who would serve as an emissary remained to be seen.</p>
<h5>The Drones</h5>
<p>The Amberosa's drones are the infinite and nearly indestructible fighting force of the Amberosa. These skeletal beasts are made of null-matter, the essence of the Amberosa, generated by a machine known as a genesis matrix. Unthinking and loyal, these beasts will stop at nothing to ensure that their master is served.</p>
<h5>Suzan</h5>
<p>Suzan is the President of Non-Named. Fearful of the Amberosa's abilities, Suzan had made a deal with the eldritch being to serve as its emissary; the curfew was initiated to ensure that the Amberosa's drones assimilated everyone but her.</p>

<br>
<h4>The Setting of Non-Named</h4>
<p>Non-Named takes place on an artificial island called Non-Named (very creative, I know, Flargy-Filler probably stayed up all night coming up with that one). This moon-shaped island was created by human settlers who wished to have an "old-fashioned" life. The name "Non-Named", according to Flargy-Filler himself, "refers to the geographical location of the island, since it's human-made. It's a nameless country. It also has a better way of describing the ending, but don't want to spoil anything."</p>
<p>In terms of timeframe, Non-Named is an anomaly. While the creators of this island want to live an "old-fashioned" life, with Lenny, for example, being a rootin' tootin' cowboy, there are a few facets of modern technology, with the most recent looking being that of a CRT monitor and a computer. With this, we can infer that this game takes place in the 90's; boy, it sure would help if we had that screenplay, huh?</p>


<br>
<h4>The Story of Non-Named</h4>
<p>The story of Non-Named is one of great mystery; according to a post on 7/28/2018, the screenplay was completed enough to allow a now-lost demo to be shown to the public. Unfortunately, we FlargyFiller enjoyers have no access to this demo nor the screenplay, so I, the FlargyFiller disciple, had to take a few creative liberties in order to reconstruct what could have been a plot synopsis to this game.</p>
<p>Now, while Flargy-Filler won't spoil anything, I find it my duty to do what he will not. At least, to the best of my ability.</p>
<h5>Non-Named</h5>
<p>The story begins with a prologue: a decade before the events of the game, we are introduced to two little girls: Callie and Mills. Callie is the one with the black hair and Mills is the one with the goofy brown hair; remember that now. They were best friends: while Mills was happy and outgoing, Callie was more reserved and timid. After a nice romp in the forest, the two girls said goodnight to one another and went to sleep; however, Mills was awoken by a great light coming from the forest. Curious, Mills put on her dress and snuck out of her house to meet with Callie; Callie, scared of being caught sneaking out by her parents, refused to go with her friend.</p>
<p>Mills wandered alone into the forest and found a massive black ellipsoid: it was a spaceship. Before she knew it, Mills was snatched by two skeletal drones and taken to the ship; the commotion made by Mills and the drones woke up many of Non-Named's citizens. Armed with rifles and shotguns, the citizens of Non-Named ventured into the forest.</p>
<p>But it was too late: the ship had begun to rise from the forest to flee from the scene. The weapons were useless, as rifle rounds and buckshot phased harmlessly through the ship; it wasn't before long until the great ellipsoid ship sped off, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>All that remained of Mills was one of her shoes...</p>
<p>While everyone was discussing what had happened in the forest last night, Callie was filled with remorse over not going with her friend. If only she could have gone with Mills, maybe her friend would've been alive and well. Callie lies awake every night thinking what could have been if she hadn't been such a coward on that fateful night...</p>
<h5>TIMESKIP TIME!!!</h5>
<p>Lenny, introduced in the prologue as being the baby brother of Mills, is seen as a teenager working at his family farm. While tilling the soil, Lenny sometimes looks over at the forest near his family's land. Ever since the disappearance of Mills, the once green forest had been razed to ensure that no other children could be abducted by the same force that had taken his older sister away. However, this day was different: there was a figure standing ominously in the blackened forest. Could it be the same force that took Mills away, ready claim a new victim? As the figure approached, Lenny picked up his harrow, ready to stab that beast of evil.</p>
<p>It was Mills.</p>
<p>However, she looked different: she was older, around probably in her early 20's, and she looked slim yet curvy. Apparently, those abductors must have fed her well. Nonetheless, Lenny was overjoyed to see his long-lost sister; he tossed his makeshift weapon aside and gave his sister a hug.</p>
<p>Mills seemed happy, somewhat. When Lenny looked at his big sister's face, she looked as if not a single recollection of who she was or where she's at was in her head. She kept repeating Lenny's name everytime she said it; Lenny knew what he had to do: he had to show his big sister around to catch her up on what she missed.</p>
<p>The two first went to meet with their family: Mills and Lenny's mother and father were ecstatic to see their daughter again. Though they had many questions, Mills had very little answers: all she could remember was being abducted and then being dropped off by the very same drones who took her captive. Though they were concerned, Mills's parents brushed it off before letting Lenny take his older sister with him throughout town.</p>
<p>After meeting a whole host of quirky characters, the two reach their final stop: Callie's house. Lenny warns Mills of how much Callie had changed since the two friends last met, however, Mills remained excited. Unfortunately, while Lenny was ringing the doorbell, Mills got distracted and wandered off. The audience sees first-hand how much Callie had changed: for a girl, she stood at an imposing 5' 6", weighing 160 lbs of nothing but pure muscle and hatred. Callie's green eyes exuded no other emotion than violent rage, and she had a borderline sexual affinity for taking out that rage on little Lenny. While Callie was thrashing Lenny for the grievous sin of ringing her doorbell, Mills rushed over to end the quarrel.</p>
<p>When Callie saw Mills for the first time in a decade, she was dumbstruck; in the meantime, Lenny weaseled his way out of his attacker's grasp. It was in that instant that the rage that fueled Callie turned into tearful happiness, as the beefy girl wept and hugged her best friend tightly. The two embraced one another, before Callie suggested that the two go on an excursion together; as soon as Lenny opened his mouth to try and object, Callie roundhouse kicked him cold. Mills agreed to the excursion and the two went inside to catch up.</p>
<p>While Callie turned on the TV to find a show for the two to watch, Mills asked her friend how things were since she left. Callie explained how, after Mills was abducted, she fell into a deep depression that she'd only just begun to finally climb out of. To distract her from her depressive and suicidal thoughts, Callie took up weight-lifting; when her abusive and neglectful adoptive parents, Callie's caretakers since she was orphaned at a young age, tried to object to her decision, she left the family and had to get a job. With this, Callie got a job as a fitness model, a job she believes she is underqualified for due to her being as flat as a board, and now lives alone, only watching TV and weight lifting. Now, Callie living alone wasn't for a lack of trying to socialize, as she had tried and failed to obtain friends due to her abrasive nature and hair-trigger temper.</p>
<p>Mills brought some food over to her friend and the two began to watch a film about killer robots together. Mills asks Callie if, instead of killing humanity, it was possible for humans and sapient machines to live together in harmony. Callie laughs at this notion, before brazenly stating that, because of how inferior machines are, they would want to eradicate the more gifted humans and would not even consider working in harmony. Though she smiled, Mills wasn't very receptive to this idea. Not all machines were bad, after all. As the movie ended, the two discussed where they wanted to go tomorrow for their excursion; the two settle on going to West Town to have a bit of fun.</p>
<p>The two had some fun at West Town, as they went hiking, stargazing, and spelunking in Mineral Mines. But, as the two began to make their way out of the town, a large exodus of people were coming from the eastern side of Non-Named. Curious, Mills asked what was going on to a man who was fleeing: he replied that a great influx of skeletal drones were appearing out of nowhere and attacking the people, with the once green and peaceful land growing black and hostile. In a panic, the President of Non-Named, Suzan, declared a state of emergency and ordered a curfew. While the two friends were at Callie's house, Mills was in a state of uneasiness; it wasn't before long that she tried to sneak away.</p>
<p>This time, Mills was stopped by Callie. Asking why Mills was risking to get caught, Mills stated ominously that, if she can't leave and go to the eastern side of Non-Named, then the whole world will be destroyed by a force that transcends reality itself. Callie, shaken by her friend's words, decided to tag along with Mills and the two snuck out under the cover of night.</p>
<p>While sneaking through the mountains, Callie and Mills were stopped by Suzan and an army of policemen. Uncaring of the imminent destruction of the world, Suzan orders her troops to attack the two miscreants. Callie and Mills emerge victorious (RPG bullshit) and Suzan attempts to stop them herself before being defeated. While navigating the maze-like mountains, the two spot some drones speaking to some policemen (wearing the same uniforms as the ones the two had defeated). Something was up...and they didn't like it.</p>
<p>While the two girls were distracted, a drone snuck up behind them and tried to destroy the trespassers. It was here that the two got a good look of what they were dealing with: it was a skeletal being, yet it had no ribs nor a skull. This beast had only two eyes and a mouth floating from where the head should be, and its skin looked as if one was looking into the vast emptiness of space itself. It had only one, three-fingered hand, and its entire left forearm was replaced with a gigantic arm cannon. On the waist of the drone was a golden icon, the genesis matrix, glowing red and swirling. In a heroic act, Mills took a grievous blow to the face from the beast before destroying its belt-mounted icon; with this, the drone swirled up into a vortex before exploding in a brilliant flash of light.</p>
<p>When Callie got up, she found Mills covering the right side of her face, blood flowing from the wound. It wasn't before long that Mills ran away in despair, with Callie running and shouting for her. When Callie finally found Mills, she was understandably frustrated with her friend running away; she set aside her frustration in order to try and tend to Mills's wound. While Callie tried to pull Mills's hand away from her face, the brunette girl resisted with great force; growing violently angry, Callie eventually ripped Mills's hand away from her friend's injured face before making a horrifying discovery: Mills was a machine.</p>
<p>Mills scolded Callie for her brazen action, but Callie heard none of it; she collapsed onto the floor and broke down into tears. The best friend she thought she was reunited with was nothing more but an uncaring, unloving machine. With this, Callie had the horrid realization that no living man loved her, her only friend was a robot.</p>
<p>Mills tried to comfort her friend, but to no avail. Callie was so caught up with her terrible revelation that anything Mills tried to say fell on deaf ears. All Mills could do was give Callie space and wait until she felt better...</p>
<p>After Callie calmed down, Mills felt it was time for her to explain what was going on: she was a cyborg replica of the original Mills created by a force known as the Amberosa. This twisted, eldritch being created Mills to be used as a emissary for humanity in order to have humanity join the Amberosa's Great Unification or die terribly in an unwinnable war. However, once Mills caught wind of the Amberosa's plan, she escaped from the Amberosa's ship, and intended to assemble a force to destroy this being.</p>
<p>The two finally left the mountains and made it to the West Station. The train-ride to the eastern region of Non-Named was silent; while Mills tried to engage with Callie, her friend remained silent and scornful. Mills was heartbroken, and stared out the window for the rest of the ride to the East Station.</p>
<p>After some time, the two had finally reached East Town. It was a terrible land: the once beautiful plants were corrupted into starry, thorny vines, the ground turned black and slimey, and the once illustrious buildings fell into ruin. Hundreds of drones were found patrolling the area, marching in unison with their arm cannons ready to annihilate any trespassers.</p>
<p>The relationship between the former friends grew more strained; everytime Callie saw Mills act absentmindedly, she felt nothing but growing contempt for that idiot machine. Mills, on the other hand, tried in vain to rebuild her friendship with Callie, but as she tried to cheer up her friend, she knew she was only making Callie more angry. Mills eventually stopped trying to please Callie, and, after Callie nearly struck Mills for getting the two noticed by a group of drones, decided to split ways with her once the threat of the Amberosa was mitigated.</p>
<p>After navigating the twisted lands of East Town, Callie and Mills finally found the lair of the Amberosa. A vast, hive-like cave network, it was a challenge to navigate the network. While journeying to find the Amberosa, Callie and Mills made a terrifying discovery...</p>
<p>It was the original Mills...</p>
<p>Or, at least what was left of her, floating dead in a vat of an unknown liquid. The young girl's head was shaved and cut all over, stitches that once fastened the girl's body parts together had worn away and the limbs were now floating freely in the vat. Callie vomited from the atrocious sight, but Mills was determined to destroy the Amberosa, to ensure that nobody suffered as the original Mills had.</p>
<p>Eventually, the two found themselves in a large, dark amphitheater. It was with this that the Amberosa revealed itself: a formless being, it streaked down from the empty air and morphed into a swirling, starry mess; an evil, red glow eminated from this mass.</p>
<p>The Amberosa was angry: angry at Mills for her treachery, angry at Callie for trying to intervene in its plot, angry at Suzan for failing as its secondary emissary, and most of all, angry at humanity as a whole. After Callie asked the Amberosa why it hated humanity, it replied that it was because humanity had desecrated its tomb by constructing Non-Named; disturbed from its eternal rest, the Amberosa sought to conquer the known universe as retribution for its disturbed nap. The Great Unification, as the Amberosa explains, is tainting every living being with its essence so that every living creature follows the Amberosa's whims.</p>
<p>Callie and Mills fought the Amberosa and, after an hour-long and very tense RPG battle, they finally win. However, as the two had killed the Amberosa, it exploded and attempted to infect Mills with its evil essence; Callie, however, took the essence and fell ill from it. Mills escaped with the unconscious Callie from the collapsing lair and the two entered a hospital to have Callie treated.</p>
<p>As Callie awoke, she was met with everyone she had encountered along the way, who congratulated her and Mills for their service. After awarding the two girls with a cash reward, the people left, with Mills beginning to leave as well. Callie calls out to Mills and apologizes for her horrid temperament, vowing to become a better person once she is allowed to leave the hospital. Mills is happy to finally have her friend back again and the two embrace.</p>
<p>After Mills left, Callie returned to sleep. The threat of the Amberosa was not gone, however, as a great war was raging in Callie's mind, its belligerents Callie's conscience and the Amberosa's essence.</p>
<p>Who won this mind war remains to be seen...</p>
<h5>The End</h5>

<!-- Baron Drygar Hates Flargy-Filler With a Passion -->

<!-- Jesus fucking Christ, what a slog. Imagine trying to come up with a story based on a few screenshots, a few cardboard cutouts of characters, and all in a game that looks like it takes place in fucking limbo. Go fuck yourself, Faggy-Filler, for not releasing the screenplay and making my life a living hell! Oh well, at least I can go to sleep knowing that I made something out of Non-Named while you sit on your ass fapping to anime porn of a dominatrix Callie stepping on your cock and balls while Mills sits in a corner and pleasures herself. Malaka. -->
