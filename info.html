<h2><center>An Appaulingly Bad Repository for Everything Flargy-Filler Related</center></h2>
<marquee>I know this website is ass, but I'm telling you, it'll get much better.</marquee>

<h3>Information</h3>
<p>The Non-Named Archive is the go-to website for a good amount of information relating to Flargy-Filler, the creator of the lost RPG game Non-Named. Now, you may be wondering how we got all of this information on a single guy; this was not a single man's effort, but rather a collective effort from us Flargy-Filler enjoyers along with the user DrexusNui and the group Nidhiki Gang. This website is only a temporary repository, as we plan to style this site into that of a 90's-looking interactable website which hosts information that, as one anonymous person put it, "...Has the vibe of an eldritch scripture dredged up from a long-lost underwater city and every word is an ancient incantation that saps away at the reader's sanity."</p>
<p>Simply put, we want to bestow upon you forbidden knowledge from an outer circle.</p>
<br>
<h4>DrexusNui</h4>
<p>DrexusNui is our VGResources emissary; without his help, we would not have been able to obtain many interesting facts about Flargy-Filler's characters and RPG game.</p>
<br>
<h4>Nidhiki Gang</h4>
<p>Nidhiki Gang is our greatest ally and archiver for the Non-Named Archive. Named after the Bionicle character of the same name, this group is stated to have the goal of hunting "silly bastards on the internet just like our Metru Nui namesake." A trolling collective, Nidhiki Gang is rumored to have been the one responsible for Flargy-Filler's departure from the internet on 10/28/2019. Nonetheless, this group's nearly autistic-level of attention to detail was instrumental in providing such insight into who Flargy-Filler is; without Nidhiki Gang, Flargy-Filler's life would've been as mysterious as the meaning of the last words of Xanadu's lonely occupant, Charles Kane.</p>
