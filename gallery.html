<h4>Non-Named Concept Art</h4>
<h5>Mills</h5>
<figure>
<img src="images/ConceptArt/awful.png" alt="Mills Concept Art" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>The first ever piece of concept art of Mills. Wow this looks like ass!</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/ConceptArt/MillsConcept.png" alt="Mills Concept Art" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Concept art of Mills, the main protagonist of Non-Named. Note the funny ears.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/ConceptArt/MillyConcept.jpg" alt="Mills (Milly) Concept Art" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Another piece of concept art of Mills, the main protagonist of Non-Named. Note how, in this piece, Mills is called Milly (an actually feminine name) and that she, apparently, has ugly eyebrows. Big thanks to Nidhiki Gang's fluency in Flargese; we wouldn't have been able to decipher these Cyrillic/Sumerian glyphs ourselves without their help.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/ConceptArt/MillsConcept2.png" alt="Mills Concept Art 2" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Yet another piece of concept art of Mills. Jesus, you'd think this guy would've drawn someone else by this point (where's my homie Lenny?) but no; at least this time he updated Mills for his new art style (now she has pink hair for some reason, no clue why). Of course, you wouldn't know that this is Mills because Flargy-Filler made the mistake of deleting all text related to this character. Never fear, we can always make ASSUMPTIONS! Name: Mills, Age: 21 (Probably), Height: 5' 4", Weight: 290 lbs., Eye Color (Or Colour, for the pretentious Brits): Brown, Gender: Female.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>
<h5>Callie</h5>
<figure>
<img src="images/ConceptArt/CallieConcept.png" alt="Callie Concept Art" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Concept art of Callie, the deuteragonist of Non-Named. Poor ol' Callie, where do I even begin? For starters, this is the only piece of concept art we have of our favorite grouchy bitch (Pretty sad, innit?) Now, let's dissect this character, shall we? First of all, Callie is apparently 5' 6" and weighs 160 lbs; now I'm a 5' 4" manlet and weigh 140 lbs. on a good day, so what's that supposed to mean for Callie? Well, according to the BMI index for women, Callie has a BMI of 25.8, meaning she is overweight; now, because Callie is depicted as being as thin as a twig and having no apparent gunt (and, sadly, no boobies either D-:), using our best friend ASSUMPTIONS again, I figured that she's 160 lbs. of pure muscle (Which, ironically, goes against the lazy nature she's depicted of having in Flargy-Filler's official comics). Also, apparently, Callie is 26 years old. 26? 26?!? That cunt must be on that same shit Lusamine's on because she doesn't look a day over 20. To fix this problem, I threw away Flargy-Filler's bullshit and made her 22. Humph, 26; I swear, some people just generate their characters with random name and profile generators and call it a day. Oh wait...</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>
<h5>Suzan</h5>
<figure>
<img src="images/ConceptArt/SusanConcept.jpg" alt="Suzan (Susan) Concept Art" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Concept art of Suzan, a minor antagonist of Non-Named. Note how, on this original sketch, Suzan's name is actually spelled correctly. According to information dredged up by Nidhiki Gang, Susan was created on 12/10/2018, with this drawing that Flargy-Filler, apparently, hates. Again, big ups to Nidhiki Gang for translating the Flargese into English.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/ConceptArt/SuzanConcept.jpg" alt="Suzan Concept Art" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Another piece of concept art of Suzan, a minor antagonist of Non-Named. Here, we can now see Flargy-Filler's excellent character design; because, apparently, Suzan is supposed to be French (her hair is in the shape of a croissant, I shit you not), Flargy-Filler went all the way by giving her a beret and a...microphone? I guess she's a singer as well, or a public speaker if you go by the creative liberty version of Non-Named. It would have been fun if Flargy-Filler kept Suzan's funny-looking earrings.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/ConceptArt/SuzanConcept2.png" alt="Suzan Concept Art 2" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Yet another piece of Suzan concept art. You know, for such a minor character she sure does have a lot of art. Now with this one, Flargy-Filer made the decision to color her red, black, and yellow (you know how I said she was supposed to be French a little bit ago? Well, I guess she's a German ubermensch now). Also, strangely, she has red irises; have you ever seen a human being with red irises? I thought not...</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/ConceptArt/SuzanConcept3.png" alt="Suzan Concept Art 3" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Jesus fuck, another one? Here we get to see Suzan's more hostile side. A bigger bitch than Callie? I don't think so! Also, what's with those shark teeth? Did the drones get to her before they got to Callie or am I missing something? What's worse is the fact that we have no clue about her age, height, nor weight.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<h5>Non-Named</h5>
<figure>
<img src="images/ConceptArt/possible_maps.png" alt="Prototype Map"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>The first ever map of Non-Named. Note how everything is labeled and the cartography looks terrible.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/ConceptArt/world_map.png" alt="Prototype Map Still"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>A revised version of Non-Named. At least the cartography looks better.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/ConceptArt/map_redo.png" alt="So Close..."  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>A different revised version of Non-Named. The western side of Non-Named looks beautiful; the eastern side, on the other hand, looks comparatively worse.</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>
<h4>Non-Named 3D Models</h4>

<h5>Mills</h5>
<figure>
<img src="images/Models/MillsModelPrototype.png" alt="Mills Prototype Model"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>This is the first ever model of Mills ever created by Flargy-Filler. Now, I'm no modeling master myself (you can see my abominations in the shitposting section) but this is some hot garbage. You know what, it's the head design I don't like. That and the ugly proportions. Ew. Though I do like that her hair is indeed brown like a normal fucking human.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Models/MillsModelPrototype2.png" alt="Mills Prototype Model Revised"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>This is, according to Flargy-Filler, a revised version of his first model of Mills. Now, I might be blind or some shit, because the two versions look identical to me. In fact, I noticed something: Mills's arms are a lighter shade than the rest of her body. Boi what da hell, boi? Donald Trump, you gotta show this bitch how to get a good tan, pronto!</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Models/MillsModelPrototypeTopology.png" alt="Mills Prototype Model Topology"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>This is just a topology of Flargy-Filler's Mills model. You think this is bad, wait until you see what comes next...</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Models/MillsModel.png" alt="Mills Model"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>The new and improved Mills model. Now we're cooking with fire! Mills actually looks like a lady you can feel good about wanting to stick your cock into! Too bad the models aren't as good as they seem, as I shall explain later on...</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Models/MillsDoBeWalkin.gif" alt="When You Walkin'"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>When the opportunity to make low-quality models of his characters reveals itself, you better believe Flargy-Filler will be on top of that like a moth is on top of a lamp's shit. This Mills was created for and seen prominently in the Goldeneye 007 hack ShitpostEye. Here, we see a run cycle.</figcaption>
</figure>


<br>
<h5>Callie and Mills</h5>
<figure>
<img src="images/Models/CallieAndMills.gif" alt="Say Hello!"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>This low-poly image of friends Callie and Mills not only shows how the two are foils for one another but also provides a nice segue into our next character: Callie. Now, where those two are at remains to be seen...could it be Silent Hill?</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>
<h5>Callie</h5>
<figure>
<img src="images/Models/CallieModelPrototype.png" alt="Callie Model Prototype"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Not as jarring as Mills's model prototype, but Flargy-Filler wants it to be known that the pockets of this Callie model are not very good. Now, what do you suppose the pose Callie's in is trying to convey? Is she trying to say "Aha! I've finally deduced it! YOU'RE A BITCH!" or maybe something else?</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Models/CallieModel.png" alt="Callie Model"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>The new and improved Callie model, now with fixed pockets! And look at that: she's doing the same pose as she does in her concept art! Well la-di-da!</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Models/CallieModel2.png" alt="Callie Model Smug"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>There we fucking go! The smug bitch we've all been waiting anxiously for! Jesus Christ, Almighty Son of God, please save me from myself, because I am ready to give into the Demon of Babylon's suggestion to penetrate Callie's tight pussy through her shorts and contort that smug smirk of hers into a face of pure ecstacy...too much? Ok, I'll stop. Besides, it's kinda hard (no pun intended) to try and fuck Callie if she has the body plan of a Rayman Hoodlum; don't believe me, wait until you see how the model's constructed...</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Models/CallieModelTopology.png" alt="Callie Model Topology"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Just a topology of our smug queen. Look at all of them QUADS!!!</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<figcaption>THIS JUST IN: NIDHIKI GANG HAS FOUND THE ELUSIVE CALLIE MODEL AND HAS CONVERTED IT INTO THE .FBX FORMAT!!! SAVE IT BEFORE FLARGY-FILLER FINDS OUT AND DELETES IT!!!</figcaption>

</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Models/LowPolyCallie.png" alt="Low-Poly Callie"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Here's a low-poly model of Callie created for ShitpostEye. Known in the game as "greenie" (No greenie meanie?), Callie serves as the stand-in for Alec Trevelyan in Goldeneye 007. Simply put, you got to pump her ass full of lead (not nut) before you win the game.</figcaption>
</figure>


<br>
<h5>Suzan</h5>
<figure>
<img src="images/Models/SuzanModelPrototype.png" alt="Suzan Model Prototype"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Good Lord, what is this? Poor Suzan only had her head modeled. Sure does suck to be the villain, huh?</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Models/LowPolySuzan.png" alt="Low-Poly Suzan"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>At least Suzan's low-poly model is fully modeled. Too bad she never appeared in ShitpostEye as a character; we can assume she might have been in a hack that was in the works before Flargy-Filler shafted her entirely. I like the Banjo-Kazooie ass t-pose she's in, though.</figcaption>

<h4>Best Correspondences</h4>

<figure>
<img src="images/Correspondences/Threat.jpg" alt="FlargyFiller Enjoyers' Threat" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>This was a funny picture that I posted on a certain Emmy thread. Too bad it got deleted.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Correspondences/FlargyFiltered.jpg" alt="FlargyFiltered by the Jannies' Threat" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>This one made me laugh when I saw it. Good on you, anonymous dude.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Correspondences/TheDefenders.jpg" alt="FlargyFiller Enjoyers"
style="width:50%">
<figcaption>While I was banned, I had another FlargyFiller enjoyer help me out; little did I know that there were more than just two of us.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Correspondences/TheShilling.jpg" alt="FlargyFiller Enjoyers' Shill"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>LOL my shill worked. Average FlargyFiller Enjoyer W.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Correspondences/EmmyfagsBTFO.jpg" alt="EmmyFags BTFO"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Saw someone trying to shill Emmy the Robot on an ICS thread. Thankfully, we FlargyFiller Enjoyers have this shit on LOCK!</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Correspondences/00XAintGotShitOnUs.jpg" alt="Agent 00X Ain't Got Shit on the FlargyFiller Enjoyers"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>So the Emmyfags tried to create an "official" thread. Unfortunately for them, we FlargyFIller enjoyers snuck in without anyone noticing (for a bit, at least). Agent 00X, 007, and Perfect Dark ain't got shit on us!</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Correspondences/Inspiration.jpg" alt="What Inspired Me to Make the Non-Named Archive"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>This reply to my post singlehandedly inspired me to make this website. Thank you, anonymous dude!</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Correspondences/SwagMessiah.jpg" alt="FlargyFiller Enjoyers are the Messiah"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>So some gay ass spammer (ironic, isn't it?) kept spamming this knock-off Chinese nandroid called Yukioh. Because everyone called this character Yugioh, I decided to join in on the fun; turns out, I accidentally became a messiah greater than Abraham Lure. The irony of all this is that the Yugiohfag was on my side recently and earned my respect.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Correspondences/Wowie.jpg" alt="FlargFag Raids for the Lulz"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>After the FlargyFiller enjoyers failed to infiltrate some Emmy the Robot Discord servers, a great debate grew concerning the failed raid. This anonymous user, for instance, liked the idea of us infiltrating the servers.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Correspondences/PerfectDarkMoment.jpg" alt="Absolute Perfect Dark Moment"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>So the FlargyFiller enjoyers tried and failed to infiltrate some Emmy the Robot Discord servers, lovingly called Pisscord on the threads, and many were seething about it. Apparently, we were Dom's fault, Dom being the guy responsible for Emmy the Robot.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Correspondences/FlargyFillerEnjoyersAreCockroaches.jpg" alt="Absolute Perfect Dark Moment"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>After I was tricked by an anonymous user to nuke an image, another anonymous user's reply made me LOL so hard! 'Roid Rage? Seriously?! Great job you guys, you made my day that day!</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Correspondences/TheVacationImStillOn.jpg" alt="I'm on Vacation, Dammit!"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Because I'm on vacation with my family (yes, I have a life, and no, I'm not lying) I felt it was in my best interest to let the Emmyfags know that I won't be as active as before. That still doesn't stop us FlargyFiller enjoyers though! Fun fact: this is the first time I made it known that Mills is capable of tanning. Callie, on the other hand, burns like a lobster.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Correspondences/AnimalFarm.jpg" alt="Animal Farm Moment"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>So I was lurking on these threads like a Babak and I found that my posts were being deleted. While this wasn't surprising, what was surprising was the amount of people shitposting for me. Good on you guys, keep the FlargyFiller enjoyer dream alive! The Animal Farm reference made this all the more better.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Correspondences/Glue.jpg" alt="The Glue Holding this Subfandom Together"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>While I was on vacation, I did a little trolling; my fellow FlargyFiller enjoyers were there to help me out.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Correspondences/EarthBound.jpg" alt="Non-Named is an Earth Bound Clone"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Someone gave a very good description as to what Non-Named was all about. Good on you, anonymous dude! I, of course, had to give an even more vague description of what Flargy-Filler was all about.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>

<h4>Other Pictures</h4>

<figure>
<img src="images/Other/Millsy.jpg" alt="Millsy"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Super huge thanks to Baldarek, the once-anonymous artist who made Millsy, a nandroid version of Mills! While we FlargyFiller enjoyers approve greatly of fanart, Flargy-Filler would have freaked over this, and not in a good way. Now if only I had saved that Mills photoshop with the fat milkers that Rusty made...</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Other/Calliey.jpg" alt="Callie-y"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Oh lawd! Baldarek, the based, once-anonymous artist who made Millsy, just dropped a nandroid version of Callie! You're an awesome dude, Baldarek, and I hope you keep making this KINO!</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Other/caly.png" alt="Shit Callie"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>A horridly drawn Callie made by one of Flargy-Filler's friends. This depiction made us FlargyFiller enjoyers confused; turns out, Callie isn't an American from the South, but Bri'ish. Funny how that is, innit?</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Other/Callies.png" alt="Callies"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>In terms of matching the concept art, though my modeling skills are ass, I think I did a better job of capturing the SOVL of Callie's concept art.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Other/2poopy4u.png" alt="Grade 3 Math for Dummies"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>The original comic was in black and white so I took it upon myself to colorize this comic.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="images/Other/UnknownRecolorHBT.png" alt="Crypto and Personalities"  style="width:50%">
<figcaption>The original comic was, like the one above, in black and white so I took it upon myself to colorize this comic. And then I remade the comic in 3D. Tan Mills is a national treasure, BTW.</figcaption>

<img src="images/Other/TheProcessofLife.gif" alt="How Mills was Made"  style="width:50%">

<figcaption>This is an Amberosa Drone. These beasts, after the Amberosa was destroyed, became the Flarggot Drones and they pledged their allegiance to Callie and Mills after the two were able to slay Lord Abyss on the drones' homeplanet. Before you ask, yes, the design of the Drones is an homage to the Beast Drones from Shadow Raiders.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Music</h4>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7E4TeIkk9RU">At some point Flargy-Filler made some music for Non-Named; however, it was lost to time as he deleted his SoundCloud account. Allow me to treat you all to my recollection of what Flargy-Filler's music sounded like when I first heard it.</a>
