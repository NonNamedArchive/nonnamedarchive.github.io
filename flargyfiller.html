<h4>Information</h4>
<p>Flargy-Filler, also known by some of the various aliases listed above, is an artist from Canada. While we do know that his birthday is on 10/13, we can assume from a correspondance from 1/8/2019, where he stated he was 20 years old, that he was born in the year 1999. From different correspondances throughout the years, we have some interesting information pertaining to this fellow. For instance, Flargy-Filler is a Greco-Canadian, in other words, he comes from Greek descent. Additionally, we know that Flargy-Filler has at least two brothers, one of which is, according to Nidhiki Gang, more financially successful than Flargy-Filler; another one, according to an 1/8/2019, is "uniconically [sic] into ICP". Nidhiki Gang also provided documents showing that Flargy-Filler was, or even still is, a NEET (someone who is not in education, employment, or training). As a result, Flargy-Filler is known in his family as a coffee-runner, instead of an extremely based artist.</p>
<p>To escape from his shitty reality caused by his failure in grade 12 and his loss of his former pharmacist position, Flargy-Filler likes to use his time for a plethora of different activities. Aside from creating things based around the Non-Named universe, Flargy-Filler has a great interest in modding the Nintendo 64 video games Goldeneye 007 and Perfect Dark; magnum opuses include the game modifications "the WWII series" and "ShitpostEye" for Goldeneye 007. Additional interests include Bionicle, Mort the Chicken, the Mother series, Undertale, Pizza Tower, Blood, Bubsy 3D, Diddy Kong Racing, and many others; if it's a niche and overlooked series, you better believe Flargy's riding its dick. Thanks to a certain user with a dragon profile picture, we also know Flargy-Filler is a big Ratboy Genius hater because it is apparently "dated and boring".</p>
<p>There is a growing theory in the FlargyFiller enjoyer community that Flargy-Filler may be mentally disturbed. If his Henry Darger-level of drawing girls isn't enough, his serial deletion of accounts before creating new ones sure could be. From what was gathered by Nidhiki Gang, this is possibly a consequence of his delusional perfectionism, as he goes out of his way to ensure that previous works he had made are not only deleted, but purged from the internet entirely. In fact, this habit is the reason why the Non-Named Archive was even made: to catalog everything this artist had made and saving it all from his own self-destructive habits. Unless, of course, Flargy-Filler launches a cease-and-desist.</p>
