<h2><center>An Appallingly Bad Repository for Everything Flargy-Filler Related</center></h2>
<marquee>I know this website is ass, but I'm telling you, it'll get much better.</marquee>


<h3>What is this place?</h3>
<p>This is a repository of anything and everything related to Flargy-Filler, a Canadian artist best known for his characters Callie and Mills. We would like to thank Nidhiki Gang and DrexusNui for their kind donations of megabytes worth of previously-lost media from Flargy-Filler.</p>

<h3>Who's Flargy-Filler</h3>
<p>Flargy-Filler is a Canadian artist known for two things: his art and his elusiveness. Most of his works are based on a now-lost RPG game that he was developing called Non-Named (What a terrible name). Flargy-Filler is an elusive character, as it's almost expected that, once he returns to the net, he will leave for some unknown reason, taking any and all accounts and art with him.</p>

<h3>Who are you? Why does this keep getting posted on my Emmy the Robot threads?</h3>
<p>I'm just a humble Flargy-Filler enjoyer trying to keep the legacy alive. As for why I keep posting this onto your threads, that's a bit of a long story...</p>

<h3>What's Non-Named? Who are Callie and Mills?</h3>
<p>Non-Named is a lost RPG game that was in development by Flargy-Filler since 12/21/2015 with the last known update being on 11/9/2018. This is where the characters Callie and Mills come from; they're, surprisingly, the protagonists. We do not know much about this game story-wise, so some creative liberties were taken.</p>

<h3>I think Callie is hot and Mills is pretty too. Got anymore pictures, preferably ones I can jack off to?</h3>
<p>Slow down, Emperor Femur! If we're talking porn, then I hate to tell you that there isn't any...yet. Flargy-Filler would've freaked (no pun intended) if he ever saw his characters get into some silly sexual shenanigans. In the meantime, might we interest you in the gallery of everything Flargy-Filler related? I'm sure you can use your imagination to undress these characters, right?</p>
